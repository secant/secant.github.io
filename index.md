**(about)** I am a first year computer science graduate student at UC Berkeley.
My interests are broadly in security and systems and my advisor is Prof.

I am grateful to be supported by an NSF-GRFP fellowship.

(Networking), [CS 61B](cs61b) (Data Structures), [CS 61A](cs61a) (SICP).

**(etc.)** I like origami, cats, and [bikes](https://bicycal.berkeley.edu)!
