## Section 4 Question 2
Define `deep-apply`, which takes a nested list and applies a given procedure to
every element. `deep-apply` should return a nested list with the same structure
as the input list, but with each element replaced by the result of applying the
given procedure to that element. Use the built-in `list?` procedure to detect
whether a value is a list. The procedure `map` has been defined for you.

```scheme
(define (map fn lst)
    (if (null? lst)
        nil
        (cons (fn (car lst)) (map fn (cdr lst)))))
```

This problem is kind of similar to `replace_all_deep` (Section 1 Q#2). However,
with the provided `map` function, we eliminate having to process element by
element.

Let's look at the case where the list is not deep:

```scheme
(define (deep-apply fn lst)
    (map fn lst))
```

If we map `deep-apply` over every element, we don't need to worry about checking
if `(car nested-list)` is a list, because `map` is calling `deep-apply` on each
element *individually*. Thus, we only need to check if `nested-list` is a list.
If it is, we need to map `deep-apply` over it. If it's not, we are returning
`(fn nested-list)`. This might be a little more intuitive if you replace the
argument name `nested-list` with `elem`.

We get:

```scheme
(define (deep-apply fn nested-list)
    (if (list? nested-list)
        (map (lambda (x) (deep-apply fn x)) nested-list)
        (fn nested-list)))
```
