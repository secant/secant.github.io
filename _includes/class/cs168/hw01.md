# CS 168 Homework 1

1. Consider three flows sending packets over a single link. The sending pattern
of each flow is described by how many packets it sends within each one-second
interval; the table below shows these numbers for the first ten intervals. A
perfectly smooth (i.e., non-bursty) flow would send the same number of packets
in each interval, but our three flows are very bursty, with highly varying
numbers of packets in each interval:

### A. What is the peak rate of flow $$1$$?
The peak rate of flow $$1$$ is $$34$$ packets/second. 

### B. What is the peak rate of flow $$2$$?
The peak rate of flow $$2$$ is $$40$$ packets/second. 

### C. What is the peak rate of flow $$3$$?
The peak rate of flow $$3$$ is $$45$$ packets/second.

### D. What is the sum of these three peak rates?
The sum of these three peak rates is $$34 + 40 + 45$$ = $$119$$ packets/second,

### E. Now consider all packets to be in the same aggregate flow (e.g., this aggregate flow
sends $$44$$ packets in the second interval: $$8+2+34$$). What is the peak rate of this
aggregate flow?

Aggregate flow:
$$52$$ | $$44$$ | $$23$$ | $$25$$ | $$16$$ | $$50$$ | $$43$$ | $$42$$ | $$42$$ | $$40$$ | $$43$$

The peak is $$52$$ packets/second.

### F. Is the sum of the peaks greater than the peak of the aggregate? (yes or no)
No.

### G. Is this the best explanation of statistical multiplexing youâ€™ve ever seen? (yes or yes)
Yes. :^)
