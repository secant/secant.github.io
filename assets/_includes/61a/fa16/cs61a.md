## Tips
* (more will be added as we progress through this semester)
* Whenever you work through a practice exam (or practice questions in general),
  resist the urge to look at solutions when you get stuck. Give it your best
  attempt first!
* When in doubt (especially on a WWPD question), draw an environment diagram.
* `python3 -i <file>` opens a session in python, with the code in `<file>`
  loaded.
* Leave me anonymous feedback [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1j2WmiTn4cWmJqtrFQk5J4NOGAbJINWJpAJDQ3TDtucI/viewform){:target="_blank"}!
