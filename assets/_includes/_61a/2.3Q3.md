## 2.3 Question 3
Implement the functions max product, which takes in a list and returns the
maximum product that can be formed using nonconsecutive elements of the list.
The input list will contain only numbers greater than or equal to 1.

```python
def max_product(lst):
    """Return the maximum product that can be formed using lst
    without using any consecutive numbers
    >>> [10,3,1,9,2] # 10 * 9
    90
    """
```

This one is quite tough. The crucial part of this problem is that the product
can be made up of *more that two* numbers. In the doctest above, it just so
happens that `10 * 9` > `10 * 1 * 2`.

### Finding the Base Case
So, the base case for this one isn' *super* obvious, but let's consider this
cases:

* A list of length 1.
    - The max_product is just the element in that list (`lst[0]`).

### Reduction

If a list is more than length 1, then we can reduce it down to length 1 by
slicing.


### Extra Work
We are finding the product of *non-consecutive* numbers in a list, which means
if you are given a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, your options are currently `1 * 3`,
`1 * 4`, or `1 * 5`. We want the case that yields maximum product, so one 
recursive call we make will be:

```python
    lst[0] * max(max_product(lst[2:]))
```

This gives us a new base case (if `lst[2:]` returns `[]):

* A list of length 0.
    - We just want to return 1, since `1 * x = x`.

The second recursive call we make will be if we do not use the first number in
the list:

```python
    max_product(lst[1:])
```

And of course, we want the best out of those two recursive calls:

```python
    max(lst[0] * max(max_product(lst[2:])), max_product(lst[1:]))
```

### Putting it Together

```python
    if lst == []:
        return 1
    elif len(lst) == 1:
        return lst[0]
    return max(lst[0] * max(max_product(lst[2:])), max_product(lst[1:]))
```
