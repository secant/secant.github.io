## Section 2.3 Question 2
Define a function foo that takes in a list lst and returns a new list that keeps
only the even-indexed elements of lst and multiplies each of those elements by
the corresponding index.

```python
def foo(lst):
    """ 
    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 
    >>> >>> foo(x)
    [0, 6, 20]
    """
    return [_________________________________________________]
```

This can be done with a `for` loop or a list comprehension. Let's do it with a
`for` loop first:

```python
    new_lst = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            new_lst.append(lst[i] + i)
    return new_lst
```

As a list comprehension:

```python
    return [lst[i] + i for i in range(len(lst)) if i % 2 == 0]
```
