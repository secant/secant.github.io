## Section 2.4 Question 1
An expression tree is a tree that contains a function for each non-leaf root,
which can be either `'+'` or `'*'`. All leaves are numbers. Implement eval
tree, which evaluates an expression tree to its value. You may want to use the
functions `sum` and `prod`, which take a list of numbers and compute the sum
and product respectively.

```python
def eval_tree(tree):
    """Evaluates an expression tree with functions as root
    >>> eval_tree(tree(1))
    1
    >>> expr = tree('*', [tree(2), tree(3)])
    >>> eval_tree(expr)
    6
    >>> eval_tree(tree('+', [expr, tree(4)]))
    10
    """
```

So first, let's look at what an simple expression tree looks like:

```
    *
   / \
  2   3
```

The expression tree above represents `2 * 3`. Now let's look at a more complex
one:

```
       *
     /   \  
    +     +
   / \   / \
  2   3 1   2
```
This one represents `(2 + 3) * (1 + 2)`**. Now you should see how this is a tree,
and as a result, recursive.

### Finding our Base Case
*Question: What tree do we have to do absolutely no work on?*

**Answer**: A leaf (number)! The tree `2` *evaluates* to the number 2.

```python
    if is_leaf(tree):
        return entry(tree)
```

### Reduction
Like many tree problems, the reduction is simply exploring the children of
`tree`, which are subtrees.

```python
    for c in children(tree):
        return eval_tree(c)
```

### Extra Work
We have two possible cases if our tree is not a leaf: `entry(tree)` is either
`'*'` or `'+'`. What we do for either case is obvious (we either `sum` or
`prod` its children. The tricky part, however, is that we need to know *what*
the children actually evaluate to (in the case of the complex expression tree
above). That is where our "reduction" comes into play.

```python
    evaluated_children = [eval_tree(c) for c in children(tree)]
    if entry(tree) == '*':
        return prod(evaluated_children)
    elif entry(tree) == '+':
        return sum(evaluated_children)
```

### Putting it Together
```python
    def eval_tree(c):
        if is_leaf(tree):
            return entry(tree)
        evaluated_children = [eval_tree(c) for c in children(tree)]
        if entry(tree) == '*':
            return prod(evaluated_children)
        if entry(tree) == '+':
            return sum(evaluated_children)
```
