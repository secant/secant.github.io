## 2.3 Question 1
Write a function that rotates the elements of a list to the right by k. Elements
should not ”fall off”; they should wrap around the beginning of the list.
`rotate` should return a new list. To make a list of `n` `0`’s, you can do this:
`[0] * n`

```python
def rotate(lst, k):
    """ Return a new list, with the same elements
    of lst, rotated to the right k.
    >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> rotate(x, 3)
    [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
    """
```

First, we should define what one rotation is. We are rotating to the right, so
the last element of a list becomes the first element of our new, rotated list,
and the first `len(lst)-1` elements gets pushed over 1 space to the right.
Rotating the `lst` `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` once gives you `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

### Solving with a loop
Since we need to make `k` rotations, and we know how to make one rotation, we
can use a while loop like this:

```python
rotation_num = 0
while rotation_num < k: 
    # TODO: rotate the list once
    rotation_num += 1
return lst
``` 

Now, let's write the code that actually rotates the list once. Here's what we
know:

* The last element of the list becomes the first
* The first `len(lst) - 1` elements of the list shift their index by `+1`.
* We need to make a *new* list

This leads me to this solution:

```python
    new_lst = 0 * len(lst)
    new_lst[0] = lst[lst(len(lst) - 1)]
    for i in range(1, len(new_lst)):
        new_lst[i] = lst[i - 1]
    lst = new_lst # For the next rotation
```

Putting it together:

```python
def rotate(lst, k):
    rotation_num = 0
    while rotation_num < k: 
        new_lst = 0 * len(lst)
        new_lst[0] = lst[lst(len(lst) - 1)]
        for i in range(1, len(new_lst)):
            new_lst[i] = lst[i - 1]
        lst = new_lst
        rotation_num += 1
    return lst
```

You can also do this with list slicing:

```python
    lst = lst[:len(lst) - 1] + lst[:len(lst) - 1]
```

### Solving with Clever List Slicing

```python
def rotate(lst, k):
    return lst[len(lst) - k:] + lst[:len(lst) - k)] # The 0 is implied
```

What if the `k > len(lst)`? We use `%` (modulus).

```python
def rotate(lst, k):
    return lst[(len(lst) - k) % len(lst):] + lst[:(len(lst) - k)) % len(lst)]
```
