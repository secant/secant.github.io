Fried rice + omelette = a match made in heaven.

*Paliuli, $6.95*

I really liked the fried rice! There were bits of bacon and sausage; it was so
savory. <i class="em em-yum"></i>

This was also the *mini* portion, the regular portion was almost twice as large!
This portion was so filling; I ate it for brunch and wasn't hungry until
dinnertime.
