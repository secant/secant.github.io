### Ingredients
* 1 cup of diced chicken breast ($2.99/lb @ Safeway)
* ~1-2 cups of whatever veggies
    - 1 yellow onion
    - 1/3 cup frozen peas
    - 1/3 cup frozen corn
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 2 tbsp. flour
* 1/4 cup milk
* Oil
* Brown sugar
* Storebought biscuit dough (1 biscuit makes 2 pies)
* Parsley

### Directions
1. Chop the onion into fine slices.
2. Put ~2 tbsp oil in pan, turn heat to medium, place onions in pan
3. Sprinkle brown sugar on top of the onions. It'll take ~15 minutes to
   achieve sufficient softness.
4. Boil frozen vegetables until they're not frozen anymore.
5. Mix together milk, flour, chicken broth
6. In a saucepan, turn heat to medium and heat up mixture until it starts thickening up (~5 min). Stir frequently!
7. Place veggies, chicken, and parsley into thickened mixture. Cook on medium-high for 15-20 minutes.
8. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F (or whatever is specified in biscuit dough directions)
9. Take half of a biscuit, and start forming a thin crust inside one of the muffin tin holes. (Thin crust is important, because dough expands)
10. Put 2-3 tbsp. of chicken soup over the crust.
11. Repeat however many times you want.
12. Bake 9-11 minutes (or whatever is specified in biscuit dough directions)
13. You're done!
