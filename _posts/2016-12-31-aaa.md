I went here with my little brother (he got the katsu). This was *huge* for a
mini size (this is kind of a trend with local food). Mochiko chicken is a
little softer than chicken katsu; but both are delicious. The white stuff next
to the rice is called [mac
salad](http://www.favfamilyrecipes.com/authentic-hawaiian-macaroni-salad/).
Reheating the meat in a toaster oven is a great way to enjoy leftovers, the
breading gets super crispy! <i class="em em-chicken"></i>
