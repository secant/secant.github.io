I've been at UC Berkeley for ~3 semesters now, and it's been a blast! Here's a
fun list of tips I've compiled for this semester (Fall '16).

### General

**Don't kill yourself with techs.**
<div align="center">
$$\text{your happiness} \propto \frac{1}{\text{classes you're taking}}$$
</div>
Unless you're crazy good at classes. I took 4 CS classes this semester
(61C/70/168/188), and while I learned a lot, I didn't do the best I could in
each class. Additionally, I didn't get to spend a lot of time on other
intersting things (teaching, research). It's really a matter of your own
happiness and what you're optimizing for.

**Figure out your passion.**

Maybe I'm a contrarian, but... AI/ML is a really sexy field right now, and
*everyone* wants to get into it. Does that mean you should automatically apply
for every AI lab on this campus? **No**, you shouldn't. Instead, ask yourself,
are you genuinely interested in AI/like math or are you interested because it's
hot shit right now and all the cool kids are talking about it? Realize that
there are so many other fields in CS that are neat and worthy of your time.
Don't come in with a narrowed list without exploring all the options first.

**Reward yourself and go outside!**

There's a lot of cool things to do in Berkeley that don't include school or
studying. Here's a few suggestions:

* Big C hike
* Go up the Campanile (free for students!)
* Rose gardens
* Tilden Park
* Movie theaters
    * I ended up watching more movies in college than high school <i class="em
        em-sweat_smile"></i>
* [Yoga @ RSF](https://recsports.berkeley.edu/group-ex-schedule/) (free for
    students!)
    * They provide mats, which is good for your first couple times, though I
        think it's worth it to invest in your own mat.
* Eating poutine after finals lol
    * Guilt is real

### EECS / CS Specific:

**Getting that sweet summer internship shouldn't be your life goal.**

Hear me out here - *especially* if you're a freshman. I find that people come in
rushing to find an internship, before even checking out other things you can do
over the summer - research, teach, take classes, **chill**, etc.

**Classes I like:**
(will be routinely updated)

* CS 168 - If you have the opportunity to take this (it's usually offered in the
    Fall), I highly urge you to do so! Scott Shenker is one of the most caring
    and inspiring professors I've met. Also, don't you want to learn more about
    one of the biggest CS innovations (the Internet)?
